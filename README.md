# Luxury-Retail-Risk-Compliance-Platform
To build a practical, end-to-end data science project demonstrating proficiency with core industry tools (Python/Pandas, SQL, Power BI) while applying core concepts of risk management (e.g., fraud detection, compliance) in an industry I’m passionate about: Luxury Retail.

Problem Statement:
Luxury Retail Challenge: High-end retailers face a unique risk profile characterized by low transaction volume but extremely high average transaction value (ATV). A single fraudulent transaction can result in significant financial loss and damage to brand reputation.

Operational Risk: Current processes often lack automated controls, leading to delays in identifying suspicious activity and compliance breaches (e.g., missing key payment data).

Goal:
To build a practical, end-to-end data science project demonstrating proficiency with core industry tools (Python/Pandas, SQL, Power BI) while applying core concepts of risk management (e.g., fraud detection, compliance) in an industry I’m passionate about: Luxury Retail.

Business Objective:
Mitigate Risk: Design a scalable platform to shift from reactive loss recovery to proactive risk mitigation.

Establish Internal Control: Develop automated compliance checks to ensure all transactional data adheres to required audit standards, creating a robust, reliable, and auditable process control.

My Approach:
Data Ingestion & Transformation (Python/Pandas): Use Python and the Pandas library to load raw transaction data, perform cleaning, and convert key fields (like time/date) for analysis.

Compliance Layer (Python/Pandas): Implement specific business rules to flag or remove transactions that fail mandatory checks (e.g., missing Payment_Method or unusual age/location patterns).

Data Persistence & Modeling (SQL): Load the cleaned, compliant, and pre-scored data into an SQL database. This models the data into a structured format ready for consumption by BI tools.

Visualization & Monitoring (Power BI): Connect Power BI to the SQL database to create an interactive dashboard for risk officers to monitor key metrics and drill down into flagged transactions.

## 📊 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

| Metric | Purpose | Resume Impact |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Transaction/Compliance Breach Rate** | Measures the percentage of transactions failing internal control checks (e.g., missing data, non-compliant amount ranges). | Demonstrates ability to **design and enforce process controls**. |
| **High-Value Transaction Volume** | Tracks the volume of purchases exceeding a set risk threshold (e.g., >$250) across different locations. | Shows understanding of **quantifying high-risk exposure** in luxury retail. |
| **Anomaly Detection Rate** | Measures the percentage of transactions flagged as fraudulent (Fraud\_Flag=1 in the dataset) that the system correctly isolates. | Highlights **data analysis and fraud detection skills**. |
